**Introduction**

***Darknight Gamelib*** is a new open source game library, mainly made for easily installing DarkNight games, but any developer can implement the API on their games.

*Gamelib* code it's open source wich means anyone can edit it to make it their own way, it's a Neutron API webapp using HTML, CSS and JavaScript mostly so it's easy to hack.

**Installation**

*Gamelib* **it's not available to download yet *(check the "Release Dates" section for more info)***, but will be avaible on Windows 7/8.1/10, macOS and Linux (Ubuntu/Debian .deb, Fedora/RHL .rpm and ArchLinux AUR repository).

​	**Windows Installation (Tested Beta)**

​	To install Gamelib on Windows you just have to download the latest version of the .exe binary, usually called "winGamelibVerX.XX.exe" from this GitHub repository or clicking 'this link' in order to install it on your machine as a regular Windows program.

​	**macOS Installation (Non-tested Alpha)**

​	To install Gamelib on macOS you just have to download the latest version of the .dmg binary, usually called "macOSGamelibVerX.XX.dmg" from this GitHub repo or clicking 'this link' in order to open it and install it on your machine like a regular mac application.

​	**Linux Installation (Alpha)**

​		**Ubuntu/Debian/or derivates (Tested Alpha)**

​		To install Gamelib on Ubuntu 16.04/Debian 8/or other Ubuntu bassed distros or higher you must download the .deb package from this GitHub repo, usually called "NixdebianGamelibVerX.XX.deb" or clicking 'this link' in order to open it and install it on your machine as a regular Debian package.

​		**Fedora/Red Hat Linux/or derivates (Non-Tested Alpha)**

​		To install Gamelib on Fedora or derivated distros you must download the .rpm package from this GitHub repo, usually called "NixRHLGamelibVerX.XX.rpm" or clicking 'this link' in order to open it and install it on your machine as a regular rpm package.

​		**Archlinux User Repository (AUR) Installation**

​		An ArchLinux AUR package will be available soon after the release of Gamelib for you to download easily just typing this on your terminal **(Don't forget to have root privilegies using "sudo su" or just adding sudo on the command)**:

`yaour dnk-gamelib`

​		***BSD, Haiku and Others* users**

​		Gamelib will not be ported to any BSD/Unix/Other operating system and I don't believe we could since it uses NodeJS, but you know how to you can try taking a look at the source and compiling it from "sourceGamelibVerX.XX.zip" or clicking 'this link'.

​		**Web Version**

​		A web version for our HTML5 bassed games will be available soon when we finish official website.

​			**Gamelib Touch Lite for Unity 8/Ubuntu Touch, FirefoxOS and Android**

​			For HTML5 mobile games there will be a web version for Ubuntu aswell so don't worry if you have a Ubuntu/Firefox phone and you want to try our games, or if you have an outdated or low-end Android phone.

​		***Gamelib Touch***

​		We're even releasing an Android/iOS/UWP(Windows 10) version soon so be sure to check it out.

​			***Gamelib Touch for Android***

​			Gamelib Touch for Android will be available to download from a official .apk file on this GitHub repo, check for a file called "androidGamelibTouchVerX.XX.apk"

​			***Gamelib Touch for iOS and Windows 10 PC/Mobile***

​			**For iOS:** Gamelib Touch will not be available on the App Store until 2018 or later (same with Windows 10), but you can still download an iOS package when it's ready, tough you can't install it because of the iOS limitations, if you have a Jailbreaked device you could try but **We do not recomend this** since it's ilegal.

​			**For W10**: Gamelib Touch will not be available on the Windows Store until 2018 or later, but you can still download a .appx file, but it's useless unless you download the source from 'here' and compile it on Visual Studio 2017 installing it on your device as a "debugging test".

**Release Dates**

*Gamelib BETA 0.01* it's planned to release before June 2017 on Windows, so please be patient, we'll announce the release date this April, be sure to check out our twitter @DarkNightSoftES *(The account it's mostly Spanish but we will anounce it on both Spanish and English there)* or on this github .md soon.
